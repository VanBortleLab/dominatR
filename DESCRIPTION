Description: dominatR is an R package for quantifying and visualizing feature dominance in datasets.  dominatR applies concepts drawn from physics such as center of mass and shannon's entropy to effectively visualize features (e.g. genes) that are present within a specific context or condition. The package integrates, dataframes, matrices and SummerizedExperiment objects and is able to perform common genomic normalization methods. The key aspect is the generation of plots that serve to highlight context-relevant feature dominance.
